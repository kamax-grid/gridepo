#
# The domain (DNS or IP) to use to build IDs - We recommend setting your base domain (example.org) and use
# Well-known discovery to specify whatever URL you want to host Gridepo at.
#
# Later releases will support Virtual hosting and multi-domain hosting on a single server, including across
# networks (Public Internet via DNS, Tor, cjdns, etc.) all in a seamless way.
#
# A single domain is currently supported to offer a migration path from Matrix while the spec concerning ID to Alias
# mapping is finished.

storage:

  #
  # This is where various critical/confidential files will be stored, like signing keys.
  # While configuration keys exist to individually set storage location for each kind, this key
  # is used to provide a simple mechanism to auto-populate each specific data type location.
  #
  # Typical value for this would be /var/lib/gridepo
  #
  data: ''

  #
  # This is where the events, channels and overall protocol messages are stored.
  # Database can only be PostgreSQL at this time for persistent storage.
  #
  # The connection value is a partial JDBC URI that starts after jdbc:postgresql:
  # Typical format is: //host/db?user=userForDb&pass=passForDb
  #
  database:
    type: 'postgresql'
