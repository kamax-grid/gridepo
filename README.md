# Gridepo
Implementation of a [Grid](https://gitlab.com/thegridprotocol/home) Data Server with basic support for [Matrix C2S API](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.4.0.html).

## Status
Alpha, Bleeding edge testing only. Full DB wipe(s) **will** be needed before v0.1 release.

## Setup
Steps are specific to your install method but high-level steps are:
- Install the binaries/images of Gridepo and its database
- Configure
- Integrate with the reverse proxy
- Connect from a Matrix client (Grid client coming up next)
